					<h3 id="1.1" class="go-gold">1.1 PREFACE</h3>
					<p>
						Currently this document corresponds closely with the more general Athena-Class Technical Manual, but as Odyssey ages, as with her venerable predecessor, specific challenges and quirks will arise with its operation and maintenance. This document serves to provide a reference for these, but not to replace proper technical documentation. The goal is to create a single reference document to provide an overview of all aspects of the Odyssey; further study in official documentation beyond what is shown here may be necessary depending on the reader's aims.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also note that some information will necessarily be duplicated, as it will be applicable in multiple parts of the document, while some parts of the document may be brief, partially incomplete, or simply missing. This is because this document is, and will continue to be, a work in progress.
					</p>
					<p>
						-Lt.Cmdr. Iron Forge
					</p>
					<h3 id="1.2" class="go-gold">1.2 BACKGROUND AND DESIGN HISTORY</h3>
					<p>
						It is a common misconception that the Athena class is a direct replacement for the Nova-class, due to its similar hull profile and role as a science vessel. However, the Rhode Island class, itself a direct derivative of the Nova, fills the need for a short-range science vessel in current Starfleet operations; with a quantum slipstream drive and significantly larger consumable stocks, the Athena is able to operate on its own for extended periods by the standards of destroyer-scale vessels and over significant distances, at the cost of having a much higher technological and maintenance overhead. As such, under the usual classification criteria, the Athena class is a Light Explorer.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Athena class had one of the longest and most difficult design processes in Starfleet history, taking 30 years from the start of the project in 2386 to the launch of the first operational starship in 2416, a timeframe well outstripping even the 20 year development of the Galaxy class. This is due primarily to a series of disasters. From about 2395 all the way through until launch of the Athena prototype, the Athena class project was regarded to be cursed by many in the Corps of Engineers, or at least to be a dead end by those who were less superstitious, to the point where many officers turned down promotions where they would have come with reassignment to the project.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Athena class was first commissioned for design and production by Starfleet Command's Scientific and Exploratory Directorate in 2386. Design and construction was expected to be rapid, as the ship was to be built based on the existing blueprints for Candidate E, one of the designs originally put forward for what became the Defiant class. A prototype was constructed at Starbase 312 by 2391, but in its initial shakedown cruise, the first time the starship attempted warp, a resonance in the warp coils caused a cascading structural failure. This forced the ship to dump its antideuterium stock along with the warp core; even this wasn't enough to stop a torsional shockwave from the starboard nacelle tearing the pylon free from the hull, resulting in the deaths of seven crew members. The antimatter dump also created a six million kilometer spherical exclusion zone inside the Tau Ceti system, which took months to clean up and disrupted operations of the system's ports and shipyards.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following a two-year investigation, the instability was found to be the result of the variable geometry pylons, which were therefore scrapped and replaced with a more traditional semi-static structure. The variable pylons would have worked with the Defiant class's Class-7 warp core, which had been established before even the shape of the ship was decided on, but the later change to a Class-8 core allowed charge turbulence patterns to build in the pylon joint. The attempt to save time by using an older and already detailed hull design ultimately led to the first of the project's major delays due to a failure to consider how the technological context had changed since the Candidate E plans were laid down in the wake of Wolf 359.
					</p>
					<p>
						The prototype Athena-II was launched in 2396, this time unmanned and remote-controlled. Warp trials up to the Warp 4 transitional threshold (102c, with the highest spatial tension reached being 516 Cochrane at Warp 3.84) were uneventful, but high-impulse trials ended abruptly with a micrometeorite strike to Deck 8, which penetrated all the way through the ship, including through the main communications array and primary computer core. The redundant communications systems failed to engage, and for reasons that are still unclear, the computer activated the ship's warp engines; while Starfleet engineers did not receive telemetry, tracking of the ship found it reaching Warp 9.4. As the ship was not on a collision course with anything for some months, a Starfleet fast-action scout followed the ship for more than a week at Warp 9.4 until Athena-II's warp core or antimatter tanks breached. The black box was not recovered, but the main problem was eventually determined to be with the deflector field; failures in the field both allowed the original impact, and caused an instability in the warp field which eventually caused the core breach.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next prototype was redesigned almost from the ground up, with little more than the hull structure and mission intent in common with Athena or Athena-II. Two ships were ultimately constructed for the first production run, with a sister ship Psyche being ordered in 2400. Athena-III passed unmanned trials with flying colours, and the project was re-rated for live crew in 2402, and four more starships began construction. After a two-month test cruise, however, signs of acoustic fatigue were found in the rear of the primary hull, which would have led to catastrophic failure in no more than eight more years. A starship with an eight-year operational lifespan was unacceptable, so Athena-III was recalled and used as a base for constructing Athena-IV. The cause of the fatigue was identified as Ravoumi'in stress due to matter-induced premature phase decay of the Bussard ramscoops' ionising beams, so alterations were made to the ramscoops and a pseudo-parabolic taper was made on the rear of the primary hull to increase clearance from the nacelles. This, incidentally, is what gave the ship its appearance reminiscent of the Nova class, albeit with a far smaller secondary deflector.
					</p>
					<p>
						Athena-IV was part-way through tests in-dock in 2405, with construction and A-IV-spec refit of Athena-III's sister ship Psyche well underway, when the Klingon Empire invaded Korvat in a declaration of war on the Federation. To divert production to construction of warship designs both existing and new, development of new non-combat-oriented starship types of priority level C or below were put on hold, including Athena.
					</p>
					<p>
						This state of emergency continued in various forms until 2410, when the end of the Iconian War came with a return to relative peace in local space. Project Athena was revived, and after a very thorough testing process, Athena-IV was commissioned USS Athena NCC-86200 in 2411 (Despite the ship being launched within hours of USS Charleston NCC-98215, Athena's registry had been reserved back in 2387). Athena had no sister ship as Psyche (NCC-97404) was delayed due to the degradation that had occurred while the partly-built hulk spent five years mothballed over Tau Ceti IV, but very careful and frequent examination found no more of the critical faults that had plagued previous Athena prototypes, and around a year later in late 2412 the first full production run of Athena class starships was commissioned, named Harmonia, Phoebe, Ananke and Nike.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Athena class served well over the next three years, distinguishing itself both scientifically and in combat. Therefore, in 2415 a further six ships of the same pattern were ordered, to enter service no later than 2418: Algaea, Euphrosyne, Thalia, Hemera, Eupheme and Odyssey (built out of the ship that was going to be Psyche, and renamed Odyssey just three weeks before completion at the request of Admiral O'Neil, Officer Commanding of Project Odyssey, following the moth-balling of NCC-97000 USS Odyssey).

					<p>6-hour rated sustained speed: Warp Factor 9.975 (5,126.06c at ψ=1.0)</p>
					<p>0.5-hour rated sustained speed: Warp Factor 9.975 (7,216.55c at ψ=1.0)</p>
					<p>Note the standard speeds sit at warp transitional thresholds (integer or simple ratio Warp Factors). The reason for this is physical, not institutional, as will be detailed later.</p>
					<h4 class="go-gold">Quantum slipstream capability:</h4>
					<p>An Athena class starship is equipped with a second-generation Quantum Slipstream drive, class 2-D. Using the Transwarp cubic scale, maximum slipstream speed is Transwarp 95 (857,375c at ψ=1.0) in well-plotted and maintained corridors. Trials suggest average sustained speed of Transwarp 22.6 (11,543c at ψ=1.0) in uncharted space. Use of Quantum Slipstream drive must be ordered and authorised by a Flag Officer with specific authority to give such an order, except in cases of absolute emergency, due to the scarcity of materials, components and consumables for a slipstream drive, and the known environmental damage current systems cause. Operational lifespan of the Quantum Slipstream drive before replenishment is 200 ± 10 hours.</p>

					<h3 id="7.1" class="go-gold">7.1 TACTICAL OVERVIEW</h3>
					<h4 class="go-gold">Phasers:</h4>
					<p>An Athena-class starship's primary weapons are its phasers. In the standard power-scaled phaser classification system, it carries one Type-IX phaser array on the ventral primary hull, two Type-VIII phaser arrays on the port and starboard of the dorsal primary hull, six Type-VI emitters (four dorsal and two ventral) and twelve Type-IV emitters distributed around the hull for point defense. This distribution of phasers makes an Athena class starship best suited for engaging a single target from "above" and multiple targets from "below".</p>
					<h4 class="go-gold">Torpedoes:</h4>
					<p>The starship has three torpedo launchers. Two forward, located on Deck Three and Deck Eleven, and one aft, also located on Deck Eleven. All three are equipped to fire any torpedo conforming to the Mark-XXV Torpedo Standard, a set of dimensions and protocols which have been standardised for more than fifty years even as the torpedoes themselves have changed immensely.</p>
