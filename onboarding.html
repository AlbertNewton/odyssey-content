  						<span>What's in this presentation?</span>
					</div>
					<p>Rules <br> How to make a character <br> Roleplay guidelines</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
  						<span>What's going to be in this presentation in the future?</span>
					</div> 
					<p>Brief Orientation for the odyssey <br> Lore of the oddyverse of [current year + 395] <br> A brief guide to being in each department</p>

					<h1>RULES</h1>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>The rule</span>
				  	</div> 
					<p>Follow Wheaton’s Law: “Don’t be a dick”. An incomplete, non-exhaustive list of ways to be a dick:</p>
					<ul class="lcars-list">
						<li>Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia or other bigotry</li>
						<li>Uncivil political discussion</li>
						<li>Uncivil non-political discussion</li>
						<li>Trolling</li>
						<li>Failure to respect others</li>
						<li>Not stopping 'teasing' or 'banter' if asked</li>
						<li>Violations of Discord Terms of Service</li>
					  </ul> 
							
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>The "Kilau Chamber"</span>
				  	</div> 
					<h2 class="go-gold">What is a Kilau Chamber?</h2>
					<p>Kilau is a Vulcan word, translating to “solve [a problem]”.</p>
					<p>As staff, if you have a problem we can’t solve it if all communication with you happens through DMs. It leads to inevitable roadblocks, miscommunications, and further problems.</p>
					<p>So we have a private channel which we call the Kilau Chamber. If you have a problem, tell a member of staff and we’ll add you to the channel. This will allow us to solve the problem together, rather than attempting to solve it second-hand by rumour.
					</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>I don’t like it here! You haven’t been able to fix my problem!"</span>
				  	</div> 
					<p>We will do our best to help you out, but if you aren’t willing to engage and help us to help you, or if you’re dissatisfied with the way we run things or feel we’ve been unable to fix your problem, remember that this button exists:</p>
					<img src="assets/Leave Server.png" class="pics">
					<p>There is nothing wrong with moving on if you find Odyssey not to your liking. If you don’t like it here, but you choose to remain to cause disruption and break the rule, we may have to remove you.
					</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Mini-modding</span>
				  	</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">Please don't.</h3>
					<p>By the Law of the Excluded Middle, an axiom in classical formal logic, either you are a member of server staff, or you are not a member of server staff.</p>
						<p>Following from the Law of non-Contradiction:</p>
						<p>If you are a member of server staff, then you are a member of server staff.
						If you are not a member of server staff, then you are not a member of server staff.</p>
						<p>If you are not a member of server staff, then you should not pretend to be a member of server staff. Please do help others out with finding information, but if something needs to be moderated or ruled on, ping staff.</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Leave of Absence</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">#loa-absence</h3>
					<p>This channel is for warning others if you’re going to be unavoidably inactive for a while (a few days or more). If you don’t do this and just ghost, you may be marked as inactive; if we’re unable to contact you, we’ll remove your character (they’ll become a background NPC), and if you want to start roleplaying again you’ll have to resubmit the character.</p>
					<p>And randomly saying “hi” in #general twice a week and nothing else doesn’t count as being active.
					</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>I want to advertise my server on your server!</span>
					</div> 
					<p>
					Message staff. We have done server partnerships in the past – typically just two-way advertisement. We put your server advert in our server adverts channel, including an invite link that won’t expire, and you put our advert in your server advert channel.</p>
					<p>We might not want to partner with your server, but we’ll probably be happy to.</p>

					<h1>Creating A Character</h1>
					<img src="assets/Oddy Emblem Square.jpg" class="pics">

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Where do I start?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">Start with the template</h3>
					<p>Look in #character-template and you’ll find a Google Doc, a blank character profile. You’re looking for the character one, Not the species one. Fill out the form, and put it in #character-submissions.</p>
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>What species can I play as?</span>
					</div> 
					<p class="go-mars"> FILL THIS IN </p>
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>What if I want to play a custom species?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">You can – Read this first
					</h3>
					<p>We allow custom species, but not as your first character; we’ve learned in the past that this causes many problems. Some examples I’ve seen in my time moderating several trek RP servers include “no, they’re not the Q, they’re the W! Very different!”, Time Lords® from Doctor Who®, and several varieties of hermaphrodite catgirls who were all for some reason allergic to clothing.
					</p>
					<p>If you already have a character, and you’ve been active for a month, you can make another character with a custom species, subject to staff approval for the species and the character. Species transplanted from other franchises will almost certainly not be approved.
					</p>
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Wait, I can have multiple characters?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">Yes!
					</h3>
					<p>
						If you are active and you want to make a second character, tell us and we’ll give you the character creator role again. If you want to use a different account, tell us so we know you aren’t two people. 
You can have up to four characters, if you’re able to keep track of all of them. I know I couldn’t.

					</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Can I be an Admiral?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">No.
					</h3>
					<p>
						For most new characters, officers will either be an Ensign or a Lieutenant Junior Grade, and ratings will either be a crewman or a petty officer third or second class. The default is ensign/crewman; a well-fleshed out character may be an Lt.j.g. or a PO3/2, if you wish. <br>
If you want a full lieutenant, or a Chief Petty officer, or something along those lines, talk to us. We can’t make any guarantees in this presentation, but you can likely have your character enter at a rank outside the normal range if you’ve got a good reason. The rank doesn’t really matter much in practise, in my experience - it can be useful to represent an experienced officer. <br>
Note that a character being an ensign doesn’t mean they’ve just graduated the academy; take a look at Harry Kim’s service record. Alternate Picard from Tapestry had a decades-long career, he was a good officer, and he only made Lt.j.g.<br>
Without the up-or-out policy of many modern real-world militaries, a lot of officers will stay at the low ranks for a long time, not through being incompetent, but simply through not needing to be promoted.

					</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Can you run an event to introduce my character?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">Also no.
					</h3>
					<p>We don’t do this for anyone because then we’d have to do it for everyone, and it’d be all we’d do. If you have an idea for an event that doesn’t involve introducing your OC, talk to staff. We have guest GMs running events sometimes, and if that goes well you might be able to join the GM team.

					</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Can my character have a disability or mental health problem?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">Almost definitely.

					</h3>
					<p>
						Starfleet’s a pretty inclusive place in many ways, disability among them. Look at Geordi LaForge, or Reg Barclay. So in most cases a disabled or neuroatypical character is just fine. But if you plan to write a character who might have severe difficulties working in Starfleet, talk to staff.<br>
The fact of the matter is that Starfleet is not irresponsible enough to trust interstellar diplomacy and antimatter reactors to people with severe untreated mental health problems, or to expect anyone to perform duties of which they’re not physically capable. By the 25th century medicine has advanced significantly; many things that are untreatable today are treatable or mitigable in the future. Additionally, for things like most neurodivergences, that in a humane society would be less disability and more just being different, society has advanced enough that these differences are no longer discriminated against. <br>
It’s alright – in fact good – to have a character with flaws, but if a character isn’t capable of being a Starfleet officer, then they aren’t capable of serving in Starfleet. That’s the Law of non-Contradiction again.
					</p>
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>What department and position should I choose?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">Up to you.
					</h3>
					<p>I know that’s not very helpful, but we can’t make your character for you. If you can’t decide, ask around about what different crew members do until you find something that takes your fancy. Or if you have an idea for a character’s position, ask about it. The more we communicate with you while you make your character the better.<br>
						Your character may be allowed to move between appointments, but won’t be allowed to transfer between departments without a very good reason, because this essentially amounts to changing a career you train years for into another one you also train years for.
					</p>


					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Starfleet Academy courses? What?!</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">These are your character’s specialist training at the Academy.

					</h3>
					<p>
						List about 8 courses your character would have taken at the Academy as specialist courses. All Starfleet officers and ratings learn basic spacer’s skills, and all members of a department learn the basic skills for that department, all officers are trained in leadership and management, and so on.<br>
These courses are for specialisms, or training outside of your character’s department. An Engineer might have Further Warp Mechanics, extended transporter theory, subspace access control and elementary slipstream mechanics. A scientist with an interest in security might have taken extra tactics or marksmanship courses, while another scientist who’s really into botany might have taken half a dozen courses on plants and a couple on geography. Someone who aspires to be a captain one day might study advanced leadership.<br>
Starfleet personnel will learn on the job, of course, but they can also continue their formal training by taking these courses even after finishing initial training, so some of these courses may not have been at the academy.<br>
For names of these courses, look on memory alpha/beta, ask us, or just make stuff up.<br>
Minimum 5 courses, maximum 12.
					</p>

					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
						<span>Can I play a civilian?</span>
					</div> 
					<h3 class="go-gold">Yes! If they have a job.

					</h3>
					<p>
						Odyssey does carry civilians aboard, but they’re still Starfleet staff with jobs, just not commissioned or enlisted within Starfleet. You might play a chef, a civilian scientist, a bartender, or anything else that staff agrees makes sense, but they can’t just be a family member of a crewperson without a job. This isn’t a big enough ship for that.<br>
						Civilian crew are not permitted to enter crew workspaces – essentially anywhere out of the off-duty decks – without permission.	</p>

						<div class="lcars-text-bar">
							<span>Who can I use for my character’s face?</span>
						</div> 
						<h3 class="go-gold">You have many options.
						</h3>
						<p>
							You can use minor Trek characters – think the sort of people that might not have a name, or if they do it’s only mentioned on Memory Alpha on a page last viewed in 2011.<br>
If you’re good at photoshop you could take a celebrity photo and make it look like your alien of choice, but if not, don’t worry, someone’s already made a dizzying amount of them on the internet.<br>
There are lots of resources available for face claims, and three main limitations on them:
<ul class="lcars-list">
	<li>No major canon characters</li>
	<li>No NSFW</li>
	<li>Don’t use images you’re not allowed to use by their creators or subjects</li>
  </ul> 
						</p>

						<div class="lcars-text-bar">
							<span>Can I play the main character?</span>
						</div> 
						<h3 class="go-gold">No.
						</h3>
						<p>
						</p>

						<div class="lcars-text-bar">
							<span>Can I play the main character?</span>
						</div> 
						<h3 class="go-gold">No.
						</h3>
