  						<span>Where is Vash?</span>
					</div> 
	
					<p>Vash is located in the Vulcan system, as the fifth major planet. Once named Tel-Alep, after a god of knowledge (the name translates as The Watcher), it gained its current name through linguistic drift over the Time of Awakening many centuries ago. </p>
					
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
  						<span>What is Vash?</span>
					</div> 

					<p>Vash is a gas giant world, heavily colonised and industrialised.</p>
					<p>Smallish for a gas giant, at the inhabited altitudes (disregarding the Pipe), the conditions are reasonably liveable as gas giants go. Most habitats are in the water-cloud range, and have outside conditions of about three to six Standard Atmospheres of pressure, 240 to 300 Kelvin temperature (about -30 to +20 Celcius) and about 1.3 g (similar to on the Vulcan homeworld). There is of course daily, seasonal and meteorological variation).</p>
					<p>Like any gas giant, Vash's upper atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, but with other volatiles mixed in forming clouds, and impurities that give it its striking and unusual orchid pink.</p>
					<p>Rather than floating under balloons like the settlements on Florfworld, most structures on Vash are suspended by cables from the Orbital Rings, keeping them stationary relative to one another. Most settlements are cuboidal, dozens of large towns stacked on top of one another.</p>

					
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
  						<span>What are Orbital Rings?</span>
					</div> 
					
					<p>An Orbital Ring is a planetary-scale megastructure. In brief, . Because of the enormous fluid velocities involved, the fluid doesn't simply flow through an ordinary pipe; it is suspended and accelerated magnetically. Start with a hollow pipe all the way around your planet of choice, and run a metal ring or some magnetic fluid or something of that kind through the middle. By magnetically suspending the ring or fluid inside the pipe and spinning it at faster than orbital speed, the outer pipe of the ring doesn't have to orbit at all, it can sit there held up by the spinning ring's centrifugal force. You can build things on the ring, and since it's not orbiting you can hang tethers down to the surface or into the atmosphere if you have the ring spin once per day so it stays over the same spot - it's even possible to precess a Ring to remain stationary over places other than the equator.
					</p>
					<p>With dozens of rings having been built at different inclinations and altitudes, all connected by many thousands of high-tech cables (most of which are thick enough to allow many dozens of freight carriages to run along or through them at the same time) the assembly is very sturdy, resilient to the catastrophic failure of almost any ten individual rings and with no single points of failure. The rings also provide an easy way to build in space, with many, many cubic kilometres of habitats and factories and warehouses and spaceports - less than half a percent of the traffic that comes to Florfworld actually enters the atmosphere, most ships land at the tens of thousands of docks and pads and mooring sites and their cargo or passengers reach the atmosphere by cable-train or hardwired transporter.

  						<span>What's it like to live on Vash?</span>
					</div> 

<p>Vash is a very diverse place - most of the environments are quite different to any terrestrial world, but they're easily as varied as Vulcan is, if not more.
Most people live on Platforms, which are exactly what they sound like, big platforms hung down into the atmosphere from the orbital rings built around Vash. Some of these have only one or a few layers, domed over at the top for people to live under the pink sky and the real sunlight; some even have uncovered spaces, sited at the altitudes where a fur coat and an oxygen mask will let a person survive outside as long as the air supply lasts.
Most take advantage of three dimensions, being as tall as they are wide with many floors packed densely like a space station, though larger open spaces are present. Many of the Federation's most accomplished architects, specialising in land, sea, high-altitude, underground and orbital design, cut their teeth under the cables of Vash, and the styles on display span centuries, schools of thought, and worlds, often on the same platform as areas are renovated. The overall effect is still mostly the rounded and buttressed pinkish-browns of the Vulcan schools of design. The sizes of the platforms, measured as their inhabited floor area, ranges from small town to large country.</p>

<p>The platforms and levels where mostly Vulcans live are generally very nice places, if a little, well, Vulcan. You won't see a thriving nightlife in Vulcan areas, but everything's clean and bright and beautiful (in that understated, almost incidental Vulcan way) and air conditioned and incredibly efficient. You'll see a lot of hydroponics bays (Vash makes its own food, and exports to Minshara), a university or research institute seemingly every five minutes, and the labyrinthine buildings of the third largest bureaucracy in the Federation. Any space that hasn't yet been filled by buildings is open above and below, creating frequent wide open public spaces. </p>

<p>About a quarter of the population is not Vulcan; most of these live in separate areas to the Vulcan population. This separation has arisen naturally and accidentally, and is regretted by most Vulcans and many of the non-Vulcans, especially those who live on mostly-Vulcan platforms.
The exception is Gluspol, colloquially called the Pipe, which is Vash's coremining operation. With a population of twelve billions from all corners of known space, most of the coreminers fall somewhere between indifferent and mildly resentful of the Vulcan Directorate that oversees the local government (there are people genuinely uncritical of the Vulcan administration, they're just not so common).
The non-Vulcan areas of Vash are as diverse as their inhabitants, only united by their alien environment. There are bulbous networks of spheres built high up by the Andorians in a three-dimensional modification of the Grand Igloo architectural style, mostly-human ugly, boxed, inverted metropolises, gothic and spiky stalactites of Cardassian refugees, but almost every non-Vulcan habitat, and parts of the Vulcan ones, are a hodgepodge of varying elegance, the unification of many architectural styles and even more cultures living in them. In recent times, some of these areas have started to attract mostly-young Vulcans again, drawn by what the anthropologist Sinveng called “the finest exposition of Infinite Diversity for fifty light years or more.”</p>

<p>A few habitats (they number many, but are all small compared to most of the platforms) aren't connected to cables. Most of these hang from balloons, and are mostly occupied by various forms of hermit.
Airships used to be used extensively for transport around Vash (they used hot air, as there's no gas lighter than hydrogen at the same temperature), but over the last several hundred years as the Rings were built, it's become far faster to take a trip up a cable to space, hypersonically along the Rings, and down to your destination (or even go by hard-wired transporter), because almost everywhere worth visiting is hung from the Rings. Airships still exist as a tourist attraction, though. Or rather, a tourist occupation. Most of the Vulcans in the majority-Vulcan population would prefer if tourists didn't visit, but they will anyway and they might as well have something to do so they don't get in the way of important Vulcan business.</p>




					
					<div class="lcars-text-bar">
  						<span>A Brief History, Geography and Sociology of Vash</span>
					</div>

					<h4 class="go-honey">Ancient History</h4>
					<p>The first Vulcan expeditions to Vash were about 2200 years ago, in exploratory chemical and nuclear rockets preceded by robotic probes. There were little more than small research outposts by the Time of Awakening; industrialisation would take an investment the homeworld was unwilling to provide. Due to the tight and spartan conditions and the prospect of spending years in hazardous environments with the same few dozen faces every day, most of the <i>Vash-sular</i> <span class="go-gold"><i>[People of Vash]</i></span> were those who followed an early version of what would become Surak's teachings some 200 years later; Vulcans with less emotional control were psychologically unsuited to the environment.</p>

					<h4 class="go-honey">The Time of Awakening</h4>
					According to Vulcan records of the conflict, Those who Marched Beneath the Raptor's Wings, with their superiority in space, were able to take control of the Vash planetary system (at that time encompassing only the planet and its moons) and utterly destroy the mostly-harmless but ideologically-opposed Vash-sular. They took over the moon bases, ignoring Vash itself, until they were forced out of the system, and Vash was once again empty.
					
					<h4 class="go-honey">Resettlement</h4>
					<p>Vulcans returned to Vash in about 1400 CE, at first to harvest fusion fuels, and once it became clear that Vash could be self-sustaining many people were moved as a safety net in case the terraforming and eco-recovery efforts on Vulcan made the planet even more uninhabitable than it was after the war. Vash stepped past an outpost, and became a true colony, or more accurately a family of colonies, where people lived their whole lives. At this time settlements were small (compared to today), suspended from hot-air balloons as there was no other way to support them, and reliant on shipments of raw materials from the moons and the rest of the system in return for refined fusion fuels.</p>
					
					<h4 class="go-honey">The Federation</h4>
					<p>In 2161, to strengthen the infant Federation (recall that the Federation was at first an alliance of necessity dressed up in the trappings of a grand endeavour), programs were enacted to encourage Federation citizens to migrate between member worlds, and in the ~20 year period that followed, termed the "Great Migration", about twelve million non-Vulcans moved to Vash on the huge warp-two transports. The Federation's energy demands were rising sharply, and with antimatter reactors still a dangerous curiosity Vash's role as a source of fusion fuel became more important than ever.</p>

					<h4 class="go-honey">Development</h4>
					<p>Over the two-and-a-half centuries since, Vash has exploded in population; eighty billion people live there as of 2418, including the populations of the Rings and the Moons.</p>
					<p>Several of the smaller moons, and the large metal-rich  moon Sykol, have been deconstructed to provide raw material for the Orbital Rings and the hanging cities. But Vash is no longer reliant on imports. With replicator technology and deep-atmosphere mining, Vash is able to either harvest or fabricate almost any material it wants to build with, so despite being one of the most populous Federation worlds, it's mostly not too crowded.</p>

					<h4 class="go-honey">Skaf'Kahr</h4>
					<p>
						Skaf'Kahr is Vash's capital city, its oldest surviving structure, and either the most or second most populous settlement on the planet depending on whether you include people passing through or waiting for a connection. About ten kilometers by fifteen kilometers and ten kilometers tall, the "Platform City" (a nickname that's stuck from when it was the only one) has a population of 14 billion permanent residents in a city of two and a half thousand layers.
					</p>
					<p>The upper levels handle traffic, logistics and government, with the Governance Halls, Diplomatic Promenade, and the gargantuan Skaf'Kahr Spaceport all occupying only the upper fifty levels. Upper Skaf'Kahr also holds the Vash campuses of Starfleet Academy and the Surak Education Institute.</p>
					<p>Down below, hydroponic farms, residential communities, laboratories and libraries, tourist amusement parks, factories, a thousand other things fill the space. Notably, the further down you go, the less common Vulcans become. Skaf'Kahr, like the rest of Vash, has had a large alien population for centuries, and gentle, regrettable but wholly natural societal pressures have caused the Vulcans and the aliens to gently separate like an emulsion of oil in water.</p>

					<h4 class="go-honey">Coremining - theory</h4>
					<p>To most of the Vulcan population, Vash is a great centre of science and technology, with almost sixty billion Vulcans working at their leisure on the advancement of every conceivable aspect of intellectual and spiritual pursuit. But to the rest of the galaxy, Vash is a source of fusion fuels and Subspace-Active Materials <span class="go-gold">[SAM]</span> a blanket term for rare materials that do things unexpected under realspace physics, and their precursors. Well-known examples are dilithium, sarium, murinite, tungstalum, teppoxinite, tritanium, and so on. Deuterium and tritium can be found throughout Vash's atmosphere, and enormous filtration plants product megatons a day of cryogenic fuels.</p>
					<p>Current theories of planetary formation, borne out by the evidence, predict that the concentration of SAM in a planet scales more-or-less with the third power of its mass (for more information, a recommended text is 'Behaviour of Subspace-Active Materials in Protoplanetary Dust Clouds, Third Edition' by Alex Ch'relror, 2382). In a terrestrial world, where SAM is not much denser than the rock around it, plenty collects at the core but some is to be found near the surface; thermal diffusion and convection in the magma stage of planetary formation outweighs density effects. This is why some SAM can be found in the upper crust of many planets. In a gas giant, the density difference is much greater and the planet never stops being fluid, so all SAM collects below the gas layers of the planet.</p>
					<p>The core of a gas giant holds enormous amounts of SAM compared to any deposit found on any rock world. The dilithium deposits alone of a Neptune-sized gas giant are estimated to fulfil the Federation's current dilithium consumption for more than a thousand years assuming no further development in recrystallisation or conservation technologies. However, the pressures at the core of a gas giant are the highest found outside stars, and gas giants tend to be in the range of a hundred thousand kilometers across, meaning it's a journey of tens of thousands of kilometers to levels with measurable quantities of SAM.</p>
					
					<h4 class="go-honey">Vash Coremining and Gluspol</h4>
					<p>Vash holds the Federation's only serious attempt to mine the core of a gas giant - Gluspol, the Pipe.</p>
					<p>Gluspol, literally translated as "Deep Pump" and colloquially known as the Pipe by its population of twelve billion, is Vash's main coremining operation. The work of centuries to build, the Pipe (actually over three thousand separate pipes and conveyors nowadays) stretches down up to forty thousand kilometers into the slush and the fringes of the core to pull up volatile and rare materials including SAM. High-capacity turboshafts and transport conduits along the Pipes allow for rapid transit, and the habitats at the lower Islands (as the small-nation-sized inhabited areas every few dozen kilometers are called) are the finest examples of high-pressure engineering in the Federation.
					</p>
					<p>No Islands have yet been built below twenty thousand kilometres, but even this far down the hot hydrogen-helium air is under such high pressure that it behaves like a liquid. Even further below is the metallic hydrogen layer, and then the core around which the gas of this gas giant planet coalesced billions of years ago, and it's the core that contains vast quantities of Subspace-Active Materials. Not only does existing SAM tend to collect in gas giants during planetary formation, but at the bottom of the largest gravity wells outside stars, processes still unexplained and barely understood by Federation science warp and corrupt ordinary matter partly out of real-space. These can be found outside gas giant cores in perfectly satisfactory quantities, but it's estimated there's enough SAM in Vash's core to build a moderately-sized moon.
					</p>
					<p>Out of the twenty billion non-Vulcans on Vash, about 45% are directly involved in Gluspol's mining efforts, making it one of the largest technological projects in Federation history unless you include things like "physics" on your list of projects. Half of the remainder, more or less, live in mining communities as service and support workers. The mining industry is overwhelmingly dominated by non-Vulcans; once you get past the thirty-atmosphere level maybe one person in twenty has any significant Vulcan component, and non-hybrid Vulcans are very rare.</p>
					<p>
						In the first few decades, Gluspol was a money pit - construction was slow and expensive, and another ring had to be constructed to help support the weight, as the existing Ring system would not hold it within acceptable safety margins. It was only the fact that the youngest members of the Vulcan government at the time might live to see the start of large-scale SAM production that kept the project alive.
					</p>
					<p>In 2325, the environment around Gluspol's tip at the time began to approach supercriticality - the air around was warm but pressurised enough to exist not as a liquid or a gas, but as a foamy combination of the two with density similar to that of the liquid phase below. The environment outside was still far less dense than liquid water, but it became advantageous to start building large ancillary structures on the sides of the Pipe, to provide bouyancy. Experts in deep-ocean construction from across the Federation developed the high-pressure structures required, and it became possible to extend Gluspol without needing to anchor it to progressively more and heavier orbital rings.</p>
					<p>
						These large, empty spaces turned out to be quite attractive to many of the people working on Gluspol. It didn't appeal to Vulcans so much, but many aliens (who already made up a significant proportion of the Gluspol workforce) moved into the bouyancy tanks, setting up homes. While it would make them less effective, a tank could be populated and built up at the density of Skaf'Kahr and it would only reduce bouyancy by about 25%, which was deemed acceptable. A large minority of historians who've studied the subject have suggested that the legal framework built up around Gluspol as a place to live rather than just a mineshaft was made to encourage non-Vulcans to move there and out of the cities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gluspol first struck metallic hydrogen in 2352. Nicknamed Hmet ('aich-met'), metallic hydrogen is a phase of hydrogen in which it's compressed so much its electrons delocalise and it forms a metal-like crystalline structure. Hmet has dozens of uses in industry, spaceflight, medicine and research. Federation science can keep it metastable relatively easily, but producing it is still tremendously expensive - it's more energy intensive to produce than antimatter. So the ability to simply pump it up from a natural reserve revolutionised multiple scientific and engineering fields overnight, along with enormously reducing the energy-cost of some very complex processes. This is generally considered to be when Gluspol proved its worth.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first traces of SAM were extracted from Vash through Gluspol in 2382; total production now rivals Coridan, even though there's still a long way to go to the core.
					</p>
					<h4 class="go-honey">The People of Gluspol - Current Tensions</h4>
					<p>
						Relations have been strained between Vash's government and the coreminers for a very long time.
						The miners generally feel they don't get enough attention given to their problems - to them, the Vulcans mostly ignore them despite the coreminers being the main reason Vash can support itself and has got where it is today. They're generally content not to be bothered, but when they need support or want a say in Vash politics or policy, they claim to find themselves underrepresented, and despite being in their view more vital and in more hazardous work and environments, they don't get as much in terms of resources and energy per capita allocated for maintenance and development as the Vulcan platforms do - most of the resources go into building Gluspol deeper, rather than developing what already exists. The Vulcans justify this by arguing that Vash gets enough to operate safely (many coreminers disagree) and that the intellectual work done by the Vulcans is more fundamentally important.
					</p>
					<p>
						Or at least those are the commonly cited lines of argument, the answer you get if you ask an impartial political scientist "what's going on with Vash?". In any group of three people you'll find four different political opinions and there are eighty billion people on Vash with incredibly diverse viewpoints.
					</p>
					<p>The miners have a vested interest in maintaining their importance to the energy and rare materials economy in the core of the Federation, as Vash is the most populous gas giant within fifty light years, and the most industrialised too. Starfleet's main shipyards and operations, multiple ongoing terraforming projects, a population approaching 1 trillion people in Sector 001, the antimatter generation plants, and a dozen other things, they all require a vast amount of energy. It's almost all solar or fusion, and about 1/4 of the fusion fuel used in the Federation's core (generally defined as the especially highly and densely developed region within about fifty light years of Earth) ultimately comes from Vash.</p>

					<p>A current source of division and polarisation is Florfworld. Florfworld is located near the edge of the Federation Core, and is about as rich in good fusion fuels as Vash. The native Florf are adept at working there, and developed fusion themselves some hundred and twenty years ago, so they've got pretty good at extracting Deuterium. They'd be a major competitor if it weren't for Florfworld's nearly insurmountable shortages in other resources.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Solid material's pretty hard to come by on Florfworld. There's not a lot of solids that can be made from hydrogen and helium, and the traces of other compounds can only give you so much, with basically no metal among even that. Without solid material, it's hard to build things like sifting and refining plants, and tanker spacecraft to transport fusion fuels. There's plenty of material elsewhere in the system, but the Florf don't deal well with living on a planetary or moon surface, or operating in space, so it's mostly out of reach until they develop large-scale automated offworld mining, which they can't easily do when every gram of material is valuable. When each small starship you build is a major investment of rare resources, not just in the warp coils and the power plant but even in the hull itself, building fleets of tankers to transport Deuterium and Helium-3 by the megaton just isn't realistic.
					</p>
					<p>
						Vash's closest diplomatic contact is Vulcan; it was the Vulcans originally who made contact with the Florf, and while the Florf don't follow a program of emotional suppression, their usual mindset of obsessive conservation does mesh well with Vulcan logic. Vulcan sends Vash shipments of metals and plastics and uncured ceramics a few times a year, as a humanitarian effort, but it's often been derided as the least they can get away with. Lacking anything they can easily trade, except gas which they have no way to ship in large quantities, the Florf are stuck. They're essentially unable to contribute to the Federation beyond artistic and cultural works, as the investment to pull the Florf out of their current problems would be enormous. Plus, the Florf by and large have too much pride to accept that level of aid if there's any hope of an alternative.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, deep-atmosphere probes have found that Florfworld seems to be exceptionally rich in SAM. An investment sufficient to start automated and scalable mining of Florfworld's moons could give Florfworld a viable coremining system in a couple of Human generations. Rather than having the rest of the Federation build every piece of a spacefaring civilisation for them pro bono, a far smaller (albeit still large) direct investment could provide Florfworld with the resources and trading power to develop on its own, leaving it with two large resource stores of fusion fuel and SAM and a way to trade for them.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The Vulcan Directorates see this as a good idea, because even ignoring the benefit to Florfworld, this will provide large quantities of SAM to the largely-depleted Core Worlds, reducing the energy cost of shipping SAM in. With the megaprojects that the Core Worlds are currently involved in, another source of abundant local SAM will be an enormous help.
					</p>

					<p>The coreminers are, on the whole, less happy.</p>

						<span>Interview with Maria Cordova</span>

					<i class="uppercase go-gold flush">Transcript from Federation News Network special broadcast, 81184.0. Transcript begins 20:14:10 TCSol.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					This interview takes place in a small but comfortable office. A small splitscreen in one corner shows
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="go-bluey">Bareden Stet, Reporter: </span>
					"I'm speaking to Maria Cordova, Gluspol's Member of Parliament for Island Nine South East, currently appointed as Chair of the Legislative House. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me at short notice." 
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="go-bluey">Cordova: </span>
					Thank you for hearing us. I'm glad to have a chance to talk to the press.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="go-bluey">Stet: </span>
					The Vash central government has called the protests that have broken out through Skaf'Kahr and T'Mevon 'xenophobic mania'. Could you comment on this?
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="go-bluey">Cordova: </span>
					Of course. Firstly the Parliament has had nothing to do with this - this isn't official action. But I do believe these peaceful protests reflect the opinions of Gluspol overall. We hold nothing against the Florf - there is no xenophobia - but the proposed Development Initiative would destroy our way of life. We would go extinct.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="go-bluey">Stet: </span>
					That's a bold prediction. What makes you think that?
				</p>

				<p>

				</p>

				The government still insists on treating Gluspol as a secondary project, despite its importance to the Federation. We only still exist because there is no better source. If Vulcan can get away with ceasing Vash's contribution to the Federation economy and forcing Florfworld to pick up the slack, they will.

				We have economists who predict that Gluspol would lose support from the Vash government in forty years, and lose.

				That would be a horrendously callous action. I find it hard to believe the government would deliberately destroy a community of billions.

				You have never lived under 'logical' Vulcan rule.
